Welcome everybody

# 2
A bit about me, the speaker

# 3
Agenda:
Good and bad of cloud
Value of privacy
And what you can do to protect it: use ownCloud!
Then what's new in 9.0

# 4
Start with the awesomeness of the cloud. Do I need to tell you?

# 5
Android phone breaks – log in on new
Games online
Chatting, sharing pics or documents with others
Free or cheap!

# 6
But ask yourself these questions. We're living post-Snowden so I hope I don't have to talk much more about this...

# 7
One note, because it keeps coming.
Police should have a back door.

No, they should NOT: decrease security for all.
Self-fulfilling prophecy: it is like suggesting to not lock our doors so that if a burglary is in progress the feds can more easily enter our house.

We have ONE infrastructure. There is no world where the US gets to spy but the Chinese can't.
We are secure, or vulnerable.

An example has been in Greece: they had phone back doors which were then used by criminals to find out what judges were against them – and kill them.

Back doors are a BAD IDEA, period.

# 8
You should be convinced now:
Cloud is awesome
But endangers privacy
And privacy matters
You know what you need: something you OWN.

# 9
So, here's one such solution: ownCloud

Core: sync and share data
Ticks more boxes
Including what we discussed earlier

# 10
Easy. I can't emphasize this enough: this is core to ownCloud. Do what the user expects. If it isn't easy, and BETTER than the alternative, I wouldn't use it and neither will most people. So we strive to make it as easy and comfortable as possible. A real modern, efficient and intuitive web experience.

It is also very flexible and, of course, cross-platform.

External Storage
* FTP, NFS, WebDAV, dropbox, S3, …
* Encryption
* Versioning
Sharing

Federation and decentralization!

# 12
ownCloud is a platform you can build apps on
Over 200 available
Top ten has 12 to 28K downloads

# 13
Most central point: YOU OWN IT.
Fully open
Development on github
AGPL
Etc.
ownCloud Inc offers Enterprise edition with a limited subset of apps which are supported
And set integration tools with proprietary enterprise tools like shibboleth, Oracle Databases and Microsoft Sharepoint.

# 14
So let's talk about what's new in ownCloud 9.0
The three biggest areas of improvement in this release are the improved collaboration features, the increased scalability and the changes to federation.

# 15
First – collaboration.

You can now comment on files and folders to discuss them with others. You’ll get notified in the file view that there are new comments.

Speaking off, we’ve updated notifications – you now have a little bell next to your user name if there’s news like shares you received from somebody.

This is separated from the activity feed, which now also shows comments and tags.

Tags are also new and you can use them to organize your files and find them more quickly.

# 16
We also improved several of the ownCloud apps. The calendar was rewritten, with the core functionality of syncing CalDAV merged in the core and the UI turning into a pure Javascript app.

Feedback on the new calendar is very welcome – and if you have suggestions or code, this is the time to get involved, we got a fresh and modern code base!

# 17
The same goes for the Contacts app – the CardDAV syncing functionality is now part of core and the app is a pure javascript tool. Your input is super valued!

# 18
Last but not least, work on ownCloud Mail is progressing. We’re building this on the Horde libraries and welcome your input.

# 19
The second area with major improvements is performance, or rather, scalability – the ability to work with massive amounts of data and users.

We worked with CERN, atomsmashers in Switzerland – they have worlds’ largest particle accelerator there doing scientific experiments that generate so much data, they first had to invent the internet and now they’re working with us to share this data between all the thousands of scientists all over the world working on the analysis and processing of it.

They work very closely with us, openly in github and we’re very proud and grateful for that. They have great engineers and worked with us before on Smashbox, a tool for automatic testing of file syncing.

# 20
The third area of improvement is Federation.

Federation refers to the ability of independent ownCloud servers to act as one server: you can share files with somebody else on another server by entering their Federated Cloud ID, that is like an email address – it has the same form, like <username> AT <server>.
We made a great step forward: ownCloud 8.2 would already store names of people you shared with in the address book to auto complete them next time. ownCloud 9 goes further: the first time you connect to a new server, it exchanges address books so you can use auto complete on all users on both servers!
Administrators can control this, of course, disabling it or adding trusted servers by hand.

# 21
Last but not least, there is a bunch of smaller changes, which are actually huge in themselves, just small compared to the big three we already talked about. 
First, there is a new upgrade app which will make upgrading your ownCloud faster and more reliable. It will first get to work when upgrading to ownCloud 9.0.1.
Second, we have added Code Signing functionality, checking the integrity of an installation to detect problems earlier and improve the security of apps – apps can be signed and this secures them from being changed without their authors’ consent.
There are many more smaller improvements all over in ownCloud 9.0 – try it and you will see!
